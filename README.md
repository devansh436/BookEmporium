# BookEmporium
Book Emporium is an online bookstore made using HTML, CSS, JS and basic jQuery.
I made this website for an assignment in college (2nd semester) and it took me around 2-3 weeks to complete.
It was a fun project and I learnt many new things and concepts like javascript's localStorage, basic jQuery, CSS transitions, etc.
